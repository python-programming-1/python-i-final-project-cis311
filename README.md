# Python-I-Final-Project
Final Project

* Commit and upload your final project using Github like previous homeworks. 
* Add instructions in this README.md file to demonstrate your project.
* We will demonstrate our projects on June 12, 2019. If you can't attend, I will try to run your program for the class.
* If the program does not run, I will have to deduct major points, so please make sure it runs!
* If I can't get it to run, I may reach out and ask you to fix your program.

There is a file name requirements.txt which contains the library to be used for my project.
Command to install the library is: pip3 install -r requirements.txt for python3
                                   pip install -r requirements.txt for python2
